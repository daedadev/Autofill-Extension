# Chrom AutoFill-Extension

## Description

This is a google chrome autofill extension meant to aid in quick online purchases. Unlike normal autofills where you have to click the input and then select the correct information, this autofill enters the information as soon as you load the webpage assisting shoppers on Supreme and Shopify currently.

## Installation

The first thing you'll want to do is download the code for this project, once you have the files saved go to chrome://extensions/ this url in google chrome. From there you will be met with the extensions page. In the top right you want to make sure that developer mode is activated.

Next you'll need to click on Load Unpacked in the top left corner. From there select the folder containing all of the code. Make sure you select the Folder, and not any of the contents in the folder. You need to give the folder with all the contents for it to be read properly.

Finally you'll need to click the chrome extension icon in the top right of your browser window. Clicking it will show you a list of your extensions where you will find the Autofill. From there make sure it is pinned so you can see the icon visible as shown in the image.
